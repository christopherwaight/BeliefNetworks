determine an initial simplex:\n  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional\n  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube\n  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points\n  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex\n  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 3.4e-14.\n  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.\n\nIf the input is lower dimensional:\n  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional\n  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should\n    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the\n    correct topology.\n  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points\n    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.\n  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.\n",

different maximum points\n  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex\n  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 3.4e-14.\n  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.\n\nIf the input is lower dimensional:\n  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional\n  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should\n    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the\n    correct topology.\n  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points\n    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.\n  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.\n"
